# Text-Similarity-App in Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine
Flask Application deployed in Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine. Consists of a Text Similarity Approach using Multilingual Text Embedding models by Google and Facebook

Facebook's LASER Multilingual Embedding Model and Google's DistilBERT Multilingual Embedding Models have been used in this app to compute the Semantic Similarity between two sentences. The Embeddings generated by these models are used to compute the Cosine Similarity score. 

LASER Embeddings Dimensions      - (1024, 1) 
DistilBERT Embeddings Dimensions - (512 , 1)

**Deployed this app in GCP Kubernetes Engine! But Why? It could be deployed using Heroku!!!!**

I initially tried to deploy the app in Heroku which has the feature to clone the git repo and directly deploy with very little effort. But there is a catch! Heroku allows only if the model size is not greater than **100MB**

Later I tried to deploy using GCP's App Engine with Standard Environment but it was giving strange errors. Remember! The Cloud Storage provided by GCP in default VM is just 5GB!! It can't be customized in Standard Environment. I didn't try with Flexible Environment. It might work!

After finding lot of useful info in wiki **I found out that "LARGE MODELS" should be deployed in Kubernetes Clusters** 

The model size here is very huge because LASER AND BERT models require torch (750 MB). DistilBERT model (600MB) and BERT LARGE NLI (1.24GB) are very large sized models which have to be initialized to generate the Embeddings.
